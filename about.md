Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/econ/). My research interets are in industrial organization and household finance. 

I make use of micro-data and employ structural techniques to quantitatively study the welfare implications of policies in the financial markets. In my current research, I use novel models to study price dispersion and information asymmetry in the US mortgage market. 

I hold both [MSc](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2024/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics) and [BSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Undergraduate/degree-programmes-2024/BSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics) from [the London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics).
