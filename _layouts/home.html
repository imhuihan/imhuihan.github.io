  <p>Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at <a href="https://www.bu.edu/econ/">Boston University</a>. 
    My research interests are in industrial organization and household finance.   <br><br>
    I make use of micro-data and employ structural techniques to quantitatively study the welfare implications of policies in the financial markets. 
    In my current research, I use novel models to study price dispersion and information asymmetry in the US mortgage market. 
    <br><br> 
    I hold both MSc and BSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics">the London School of Economics and Political Science </a>.
    <br><br> 
    My <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iFrYfe3i19xgL40cqhVtipmHF_m-gVOK/view?usp=sharing">CV</a> and 
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18WSmE6mB5wZansjW8Lk3hEbgReWxGD7U/view?usp=sharing">Resume</a>  are here.

  <h2>Research</h2>
Price Discrimination and Adverse Selection in the U.S. Mortgage Market (draft coming soon)<button id="p1">Abstract</button>
<p id="paragraph1" style="display:none;"> I document substantial price dispersion in the US mortgage market, with each given lender charging observably similar borrowers different rates for similar loans. 
  To explain this conditional price dispersion, I estimate a structural model that features borrowers' demand for mortgages and lenders' individualized optimal price decisions.
   A novel component of the model is the way it captures adverse selection through a flexible correlation between the unobserved determinants of borrowers' demand for mortgages and lenders' costs,
    allowing for the interaction between price discrimination and adverse selection. 
    I structurally decompose the unexplained price dispersion into cost-based price adjustments and demand-based price discrimination: cost-component accounts for 21.9%, and demand accounts for 78.1% of total unexplained dispersion. 
    The counterfactual analysis reveals that without information asymmetry, consumers benefit from the status quo degree of individualized pricing compared to uniform pricing on average because it drives down equilibrium prices. The effect is heterogeneous across income groups with the high-income benefiting more. </p>

 Discounts through Loan Guarantee: A Study of Shadow Bank Lending in the U.S. Mortgage Market <button id="p2">Abstract</button>
 <p id="paragraph2" style="display:none;"> In recent decades, there has been a shift in the US mortgage market from traditional banks' balance sheet lending to shadow banks' originate-to-distribute lending. I show evidence that non-banks lend more to the low-income and charge lower interest rates than banks, with price differences greater among the low-income. To explain why non-banks can offer lower prices, I study the loan guarantee scheme offered by government-sponsored entities (GSEs). I exploit a regression discontinuity design at the eligibility cutoff for GSEs' loan guarantees. I find that interest rates jump discontinuously at the eligibility cutoff for non-banks but not banks. To explain this price gap, I estimate a structural model of mortgage demand and mortgage lender competition. The results suggest that shadow banks charge similar mark-ups to banks, have lower marginal costs, and hence offer lower prices than banks. I conclude that nonbanks' lower rates are mostly driven by their cost savings, with a possible channel being GSE's loan guarantee scheme. </p>
