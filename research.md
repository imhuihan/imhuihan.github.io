<p><em>Price Discrimination and Adverse Selection in the U.S. Mortgage Market</em></p>

<h1> Cross-subsidies through Loan Guarantee: A Study of Shadow Bank Lending in the U.S. Mortgage Market</h1>
<p>In recent decades, there has been a shift in the US mortgage market from traditional banks' balance sheet lending to shadow banks' originate-to-distribute lending. To evaluate the effect of this change in the mortgage market landscape, I show evidence of cross-subsidies: shadow banks charge lower interest rates compared to banks to observably similar borrowers and the difference is larger for the low income than the high income. Moreover, shadow banks lend disproportionately more to regions with lower average income and higher minority populations. To explain why shadow banks can offer lower prices, I study the loan guarantee scheme by government-sponsored entities (GSEs). I exploit a regression discontinuity design at the eligibility cutoff for GSEs' loan guarantees and find that interest rates jump discontinuously at the eligibility cutoff for nonbanks but not banks. I estimate a structural model of mortgage demand and lender competition in the US mortgage market. The results suggest that shadow banks charge similar mark-ups to banks, have lower marginal costs, and hence offer lower prices than banks across all income groups. Shadow banks' costs remain lower than banks across all income groups with a slightly higher gap for the lower income. I conclude by presenting suggestive evidence that shadow banks benefit from a lighter regulatory burden than banks so that they can exploit the loan guarantee scheme to sustain lower costs.</p>
