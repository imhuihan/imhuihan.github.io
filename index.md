I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Boston University. My research field falls in empirical industrial organization and household finance. My current projects make use of micro-data and employ structural techniques to quantitatively study the industrial organization of the US mortgage market. I hold both a BSc and MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics.
