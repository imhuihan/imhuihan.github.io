[Research](./research.md)

Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Boston University. My research interets are in empirical industrial organization and finance. 

I make use of micro-data and employ structural techniques to quantitatively study the welfare implications of policies in the financial markets. In my current research, I use novel models to study price dispersion and information asymmetry in the US mortgage market. 

I hold both MSc and BSc degrees in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics.
